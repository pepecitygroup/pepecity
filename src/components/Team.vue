The idea for Pepe City was born out of a group of crypto enthusiasts who wanted to create a space where people could come together to enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrency in a relaxed and luxurious environment. The founders of Pepe City saw an opportunity to create a unique experience that would appeal to both cryptocurrency investors and travelers looking for a unique vacation destination.

      <p class="my-4">
To bring their vision to life, the founders of Pepe City created a digital asset called the Pepe City Coin. This cryptocurrency will be used by guests to pay for various services at the resort, including accommodations, dining, and activities.

      One of the key features of Pepe City is that the future stakeholders will have the opportunity to secure a Pepe Passport/Visa as a non-fungible token (NFT). The passport will grant varying levels of access based on the quantity of tokens held in conjunction with the NFT. Our foremost stakeholders will receive a NFT airdrop as a reward. Additionally, all holders of PPC will consistently receive discounts.
