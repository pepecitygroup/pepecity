      Pepe City is a luxury resort located in El Salvador that has been designed specifically for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The resort is named after Pepe the Frog, a popular internet meme that has become a symbol of the alt-right movement.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">One of the key features of the Pepe City Coin is its DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This allows coin holders to have a say in how the resort is run and how the coin is used. By participating in the DAO, investors can help shape the future of the resort and potentially increase the value of their investment.</p>
